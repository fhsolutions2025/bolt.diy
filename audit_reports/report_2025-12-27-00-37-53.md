The commit with the message "AI Security Audit Report" introduces a new file named `report_2025-12-27-00-37-46.md` into the `audit_reports` directory. This file appears to be an AI-generated security audit report, as indicated by its name and the commit message.

Without access to the content of the `report_2025-12-27-00-37-46.md` file, it's challenging to assess the specific security risks identified in the audit. However, the inclusion of such a report suggests a proactive approach to identifying and mitigating potential security vulnerabilities within the project.

To thoroughly evaluate the security risks, I recommend reviewing the contents of the `report_2025-12-27-00-37-46.md` file. This report should provide detailed insights into any identified vulnerabilities and suggested remediation steps.
