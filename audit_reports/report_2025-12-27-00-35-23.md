The commit titled "AI Security Audit Report" introduces a new file named `report_2025-12-27-00-35-16.md` into the `audit_reports` directory of the `bolt.diy` repository. This file comprises 15 lines, all additions, and no deletions. The commit does not modify any existing code or configurations.

Given that the commit solely adds a markdown file containing an AI-generated security audit report without altering any code or configurations, it does not introduce any immediate security risks to the repository. However, it's important to ensure that the content of the report is accurate and actionable. If the report contains recommendations for code changes or security improvements, those should be reviewed and implemented as appropriate to enhance the repository's security posture.
