# AI Security Audit Report

## Date: 2025-12-27

### Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of the AI security audit conducted on the `bolt.diy` project. The audit aimed to identify potential security vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for mitigation.

### Methodology

The audit involved a comprehensive review of the project's codebase, focusing on areas such as data handling, authentication mechanisms, and third-party dependencies.

### Findings

1. **Data Handling**: No sensitive data is stored in plaintext. However, some data is transmitted over HTTP instead of HTTPS, which could be intercepted.

2. **Authentication Mechanisms**: The project utilizes basic authentication, which is susceptible to brute-force attacks. Implementing multi-factor authentication is recommended.

3. **Third-Party Dependencies**: Several dependencies are outdated and may contain known vulnerabilities. Regular updates and monitoring for security patches are advised.

### Recommendations

- **Data Transmission**: Ensure all data is transmitted over HTTPS to prevent interception.

- **Authentication**: Upgrade to a more secure authentication method, such as OAuth 2.0, and implement multi-factor authentication.

- **Dependencies**: Regularly update third-party dependencies and monitor for security patches.

### Conclusion

Addressing the identified issues will enhance the security posture of the `bolt.diy` project and protect against potential threats.

**Analysis of Security Risks:**

1. **Data Transmission Over HTTP:**
   - *Risk:* Transmitting data over HTTP exposes it to potential interception and man-in-the-middle attacks.
   - *Recommendation:* Implement HTTPS across all endpoints to encrypt data in transit.

2. **Basic Authentication:**
   - *Risk:* Basic authentication transmits credentials in an easily decodable format, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
   - *Recommendation:* Transition to OAuth 2.0 for secure token-based authentication and enforce multi-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security.

3. **Outdated Third-Party Dependencies:**
   - *Risk:* Using outdated dependencies can introduce known vulnerabilities into the project.
   - *Recommendation:* Establish a routine for updating dependencies and monitor them for security patches to mitigate potential risks.

By addressing these vulnerabilities, the `bolt.diy` project can significantly improve its security and resilience against potential threats.
