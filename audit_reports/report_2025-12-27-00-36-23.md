Based on the available information, this commit does not introduce any code changes or modifications to existing files. It solely adds a markdown file intended to document the results of an AI security audit. Therefore, there are no immediate security risks associated with this commit.

However, it's important to ensure that the content of the audit report is accurate and comprehensive. If the report identifies any vulnerabilities or security concerns within the project, those issues should be addressed promptly to maintain the security and integrity of the `bolt.diy` repository.

Additionally, if the audit report contains sensitive information, such as details about vulnerabilities or security configurations, consider restricting access to the report or removing sensitive details before making it publicly accessible.

In summary, while this commit does not introduce direct security risks, it's essential to review the audit report's content and take appropriate actions based on its findings.
