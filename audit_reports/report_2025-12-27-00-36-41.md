Upon reviewing the commit, there are no immediate indications of security risks associated with this change. The addition of a markdown file for reporting purposes does not inherently introduce vulnerabilities.

However, it's important to ensure that the content of the audit report does not inadvertently expose sensitive information. For instance, if the report includes details about system configurations, access controls, or other sensitive data, it could pose a security risk if accessed by unauthorized individuals.

To mitigate potential risks, consider the following best practices:

- **Access Control:** Ensure that the audit report is stored in a location with appropriate access permissions, restricting access to authorized personnel only.

- **Content Review:** Before publishing or sharing the report, review its content to confirm that it does not contain sensitive information that could be exploited if disclosed.

- **Data Sanitization:** If the report includes data from production systems, ensure that any sensitive information is anonymized or removed to prevent unintentional exposure.

By adhering to these practices, you can help maintain the security and confidentiality of your systems while utilizing audit reports for analysis and improvement.
