# AI Security Audit Report

## Date: 2025-12-27

## Summary

This report provides an overview of the security audit conducted on the AI components of the project. The audit aims to identify potential vulnerabilities and recommend mitigation strategies.

## Findings

- **Data Privacy:** The AI system processes sensitive user data without adequate encryption, posing a risk of unauthorized access.

- **Model Robustness:** The model is susceptible to adversarial attacks, which could lead to incorrect outputs under certain conditions.

## Recommendations

- **Data Encryption:** Implement end-to-end encryption for all sensitive data processed by the AI system.

- **Adversarial Training:** Incorporate adversarial training techniques to enhance the model's robustness against potential attacks.

## Conclusion

Addressing the identified issues will significantly improve the security posture of the AI components, ensuring safer and more reliable operation.

**Security Risks Identified:**

1. **Data Privacy Concerns:** The AI system processes sensitive user data without adequate encryption, which could lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

2. **Model Vulnerabilities:** The model is susceptible to adversarial attacks, which could result in incorrect outputs under specific conditions, potentially compromising the system's reliability and trustworthiness.

**Recommendations:**

- **Data Encryption:** Implement end-to-end encryption for all sensitive data processed by the AI system to safeguard against unauthorized access.

- **Adversarial Training:** Incorporate adversarial training techniques to enhance the model's robustness, making it more resilient to potential attacks.

By addressing these issues, the security and reliability of the AI components can be significantly improved, ensuring safer operation.
