The commit titled "AI Security Audit Report" introduces a new file named `report_2025-12-27-00-39-17.md` into the repository. This file contains a security audit report, which is a valuable addition for identifying and mitigating potential security risks within the project.

However, without access to the specific contents of the `report_2025-12-27-00-39-17.md` file, it's challenging to provide a detailed analysis of the identified security risks. To effectively assess and address these risks, it is essential to review the audit report's findings and recommendations.

In general, incorporating regular security audits into the development process is a best practice for maintaining the integrity and security of the project. By proactively identifying vulnerabilities, developers can implement appropriate measures to safeguard the application and its users.
