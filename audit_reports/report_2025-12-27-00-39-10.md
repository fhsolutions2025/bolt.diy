**Potential Security Considerations:**

1. **Accuracy of AI-Generated Reports:** AI tools can sometimes produce false positives or miss vulnerabilities. It's essential to verify the findings with manual reviews or additional tools.

2. **Confidential Information Exposure:** Ensure that the report does not contain sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, or proprietary code details.
