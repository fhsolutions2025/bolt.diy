The commit titled "AI Security Audit Report" introduces a new file, `report_2025-12-27-00-38-54.md`, into the repository. This file contains a 34-line markdown document detailing the findings of an AI security audit conducted on the project.

**Key Findings:**

- **Vulnerabilities Identified:** The audit highlights several security vulnerabilities within the codebase, including potential injection points and inadequate input validation mechanisms.

- **Recommendations:** The report provides actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified risks, such as implementing parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks and enhancing input validation to ensure data integrity.

**Security Risks:**

The primary security risks associated with this commit include:

1. **Injection Vulnerabilities:** The presence of unsanitized inputs that could be exploited to execute malicious code.

2. **Insufficient Input Validation:** Lack of rigorous checks on user inputs, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors or security breaches.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To address these risks, the following strategies are recommended:

- **Sanitize User Inputs:** Ensure all user inputs are properly sanitized to prevent malicious code execution.

- **Enhance Input Validation:** Implement comprehensive validation checks to verify the correctness and safety of user-provided data.

By incorporating these measures, the project can significantly improve its security posture and safeguard against potential threats.
